    "## Possible Layer Types in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides a variety of layer types that can be used to build neural networks. Some of the most commonly used layers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Layer (`torch.nn.Linear`)**:\n",
    "    - Applies a linear transformation to the incoming data: $y = xA^T + b$\n",
    "    - Parameters: `in_features` (size of each input sample), `out_features` (size of each output sample), `bias` (if set to False, the layer will not learn an additive bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convolutional Layer (`torch.nn.Conv2d`)**:\n",
    "    - Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input planes\n",
    "    - Parameters: `in_channels`, `out_channels`, `kernel_size`, `stride`, `padding`, `dilation`, `groups`, `bias`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recurrent Layers (`torch.nn.RNN`, `torch.nn.LSTM`, `torch.nn.GRU`)**:\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.RNN`: Applies a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) to an input sequence\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.LSTM`: Applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to an input sequence\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.GRU`: Applies a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to an input sequence\n",
    "    - Parameters: `input_size`, `hidden_size`, `num_layers`, `bias`, `batch_first`, `dropout`, `bidirectional`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dropout Layer (`torch.nn.Dropout`)**:\n",
    "    - Randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with probability `p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "    - Parameters: `p` (probability of an element to be zeroed)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Batch Normalization Layer (`torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`)**:\n",
    "    - Applies Batch Normalization over a 2D or 4D input\n",
    "    - Parameters: `num_features`, `eps`, `momentum`, `affine`, `track_running_stats`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Activation Functions**:\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.ReLU`: Applies the rectified linear unit function element-wise\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.Sigmoid`: Applies the sigmoid function element-wise\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.Tanh`: Applies the hyperbolic tangent function element-wise\n",
    "    - `torch.nn.Softmax`: Applies the Softmax function to an n-dimensional input Tensor rescaling them so that the elements of the n-dimensional output Tensor lie in the range [0, 1] and sum to 1\n",

    "## `torch.nn.Module` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `torch.nn.Module` class is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. It provides a way to encapsulate parameters, layers, and methods for building and training neural networks. Here are some key features and functionalities of the `torch.nn.Module` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:\n",
    "    - This method is used to define the layers and parameters of the model.\n",
    "    - Layers are typically instances of other `torch.nn` modules (e.g., `torch.nn.Linear`, `torch.nn.Conv2d`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward Pass (`forward` method)**:\n",
    "    - This method defines the computation performed at every call.\n",
    "    - It takes an input tensor and returns an output tensor.\n",
    "    - The `forward` method is called automatically when the module is called (e.g., `output = model(input)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parameters**:\n",
    "    - Parameters are instances of `torch.nn.Parameter`, which are tensors that are considered as model parameters.\n",
    "    - They are automatically registered as parameters when assigned as attributes of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Submodules**:\n",
    "    - Modules can contain other modules (submodules), which are registered as submodules when assigned as attributes.\n",
    "    - This allows for building complex models by composing simpler modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Device Management**:\n",
    "    - Modules can be moved to different devices (e.g., CPU, GPU) using the `to` method.\n",
    "    - This ensures that all parameters and buffers are moved to the specified device.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Training and Evaluation Modes**:\n",
    "    - Modules can be set to training mode using `model.train()` and evaluation mode using `model.eval()`.\n",
    "    - This affects certain layers like dropout and batch normalization, which behave differently during training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
