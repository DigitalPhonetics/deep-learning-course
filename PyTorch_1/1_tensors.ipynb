    "# Tensors\n",
    "## Tensor creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are Pytorch's data structure for representing vectors, matrices and higher dimensional tensors.\n",
    "Tensors contain homogeneous data of fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be initialized from Python objects, e.g., a list of lists of integers, making up a $n\\times m$ dimensional array.\n",
    "You just call `torch.tensor(data)` where `data` is the Python object.\n",
    "The data type is automatically inferred, but you can override this behavior by setting the `dtype` argument when calling `torch.tensor`, where `dtype` is one of the PyTorch dtypes as listed at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#data-types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensors from functions with random or constant values\n",
    "PyTorch provides several functions to create tensors with random or constant values:\n",
    "* `torch.ones(size)`: Creates a tensor filled with ones.\n",
    "* `torch.zeros(size)`: Creates a tensor filled with zeros.\n",
    "* `torch.eye(size)`: Creates a 2D tensor with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere (identity matrix).\n",
    "* `torch.rand(size)`: Creates a tensor with random values uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* `torch.randn(size)`: Creates a tensor with random values from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.\n",
    "* `torch.full(size, fill_value)`: Creates a tensor filled with the specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensors from other tensors\n",
    "You can create new tensors from existing tensors. This can be done using various functions:\n",
    "* `torch.clone(tensor)`: Creates a copy of the tensor.\n",
    "* `tensor.new_tensor(data)`: Creates a new tensor with the same properties (dtype, device) as the original tensor.\n",
    "* `tensor.expand(size)`: Expands the tensor to a larger size without copying data.\n",
    "* `tensor.view(size)`: Returns a new tensor with the same data but different shape.\n",
    "* `tensor.to(dtype)`: Converts the tensor to a different data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `size` is a sequence of integers defining the shape of the output tensor, and `dtype` is of type `torch.dtype`, e.g., `torch.float32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Device allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify the device where the tensor lives, e.g., on CPU (default) or GPU.\n",
    "For this, you can pass the `device` argument to the tensor creation functions, which takes an object of type `torch.device` ([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_attributes.html#torch-device)).\n",
    "These can be created by calling `torch.device` with a device type, e.g., `'cpu'` or `'cuda'` (for GPU), and an ordinal specifying the the device id.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensor attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes allow inspecting some properties of the tensors, e.g., `shape`, `dtype` and `device`.\n",
    "They can be valuable when creating neural networks."
