# Brief Git Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It helps track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate efficiently. Git is widely used in both open-source and commercial software development.

Key features of Git:
- **Branching and Merging**: Create branches to work on different features or fixes and merge them back into the main branch when ready.
- **Distributed Development**: Every developer has a local copy of the entire project history, enabling offline work and reducing dependency on a central server.
- **Staging Area**: Prepare commits by staging changes, allowing for more control over what is included in a commit.
- **Commit History**: Maintain a detailed history of changes, making it easier to track progress and understand the evolution of a project.

Common Git commands:
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone`: Clone an existing repository.
- `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
- `git commit`: Commit staged changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Push local commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
