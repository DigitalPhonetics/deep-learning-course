# Brief SSH Introduction
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.
