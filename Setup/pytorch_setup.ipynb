    "Then, create a new environment with ```conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11``` (conda) or ```python -m virtualenv <path_to_env> --python python3.11``` (pip) - note that this needs Python 3.11 installed for pip or installs Python 3.11 in case of conda since this tutorial uses Python 3.11!\\\n",
